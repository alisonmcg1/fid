<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Established in 2006, we strive every day to make the shopping experience easier for everyone. We originally came up with this idea in 2003 when one of us wanted to find a certain product, but didn't know where or how to search for which stores that certain product could be sold. A few years later, Store Hunter™ was born. Our headquarters is located in Central Florida where most of our employees work. We enjoy helping people find what they are looking for, and we are happy to help if you get stuck along the way.</p>
