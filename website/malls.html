<h2>Find a Mall</h2>
<p>If you like shopping at the mall, you've come to the right place. Here is where you can type in your address and find an active nearby mall to shop at based on where you live. It will also show you which stores are located inside that mall. Or if you just want to have fun and hang out at a mall, you can use this section of our website for that as well. The malls we provide to you are quite active, aren't dead, and have a lot of good reviews.</p>
